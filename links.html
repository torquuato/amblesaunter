                <p>> i had to study rufino tamayo for my art class and this piece always stood out to me. i very vividly
                    remember recreating this piece with pastels and then getting a finger cut on the page and being
                    super freaked out about it. this piece is definetly haunted.</p>

                <p>> when looking at older renaissance paintings, i remember seeing this piece and just sort of looking
                    at all the different details. when looking for pictures online to use for it, i found this section
                    which i for some reason vivdly remember.</p>
