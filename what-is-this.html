        <p>hi. this is my submission for the november 2025 melon jam.</p>
        <p>the theme was "Out with the new. In with the old.". after a bit of brainstorming, my mind kind of went to old
            point and click adventure games i used to play/watch (hi broken sword fans). this combined with a bit of
            inspo from mspa (homestuck/problem slueth)..... this was born. a game where you dont particularly do much
            but take a bit of a stroll and a gander at the wacky world you are in.</p>
        <p>i am aware of how poop it is. im sorta kinda new to web dev. and i sorta kinda havent drawn properly in a
            LONG while. so... its gonna be KINDA not that great aha. dont get me wrong i TRIED. like ive fully learnt
            about image mapping stuff (i was doing it manually and then realised there was a freakin site that can do it
            for you). and ive fully tried drawing with the good ol' mouse. the reason you cant really do much is bcs i
            havent had the time to learn js properly tbh. especially not for a game jam and especially not with college
            and the other things ive signed myself up for. but eh. idrc. its cool bcs i said it is.</p>
        <p>i think ill do like a cool credits section here. BIG inspiration (if you couldnt already tell) was <a
                href="https://neocities.org/site/catarinha">you approach the i-land</a> by catarinha. again i am NEW to
            this whole "indie-web" scene and only discovered i-land like a few days ago... and FELL IN LOVE. GOD. is
            that not just like the coolest project ever. i think im currently on like 270 something out of 300. err
            sorry. anyways. the site i used for the image mapping was <a
                href="https://www.image-map.net/">https://www.image-map.net/</a>. really good site for this. again i was
            trying to map ts MANUALLY and i nearly gave up after like... a while. last credit? mvp gotttaaa be win11
            paint. like, ok win11 rubbed me the wrong way at first but GOLLY is paint fun to use in win11. like you can
            do layers n stuff??? anyway thats it go play the game or i-land or hi.
