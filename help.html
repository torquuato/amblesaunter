        <h1>help</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">>back</a></p>

        <p>hover over stuff to see if it is interactable. take your time, hovering over something for a few seconds will let you inspect it, providing a very brief description of how you can interact with it and/or what it is.</p>
        <p>other than that there shouldnt be too much more you would need help on i think?</p>
        <p>if you are stuck in an area, there is more than likely a way to get back to the previous page (normally somewhere on the bottom area of the box, or the left and right of the box).</p>
        <p>oh and <b>desktop browser + F11 (to fullscreen) for the best experience!</b></p>
